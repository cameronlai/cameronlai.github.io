Create 3D Text with a simple web app

[Web App](http://font3d.cameronlai.com/)

[Source Code]("https://github.com/cameronlai/font3d)

Want to make something special with a 3D printer for your friend? Then, font3d will be a great tool for you. You can use the web interface to generate a 3D STL file with any text you want. In the background, there is a script that runs the Open SCAD commands and builds the 3D STL file for you. The STL file is then ready to be printed on your 3D printer, which you can tweak the dimensions and pick your filament colour. Currently, only upper case letters, numbers 0-9 and spaces are supported. In addition, one basic font type is provided. Hope you will enjoy using font3d for 3D printing. :)
