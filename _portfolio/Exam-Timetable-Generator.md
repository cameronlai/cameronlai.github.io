Did you remember the times when you had exams in a row? Did you ever wonder how did the school arrange these awful exam timetables? I had a number of these experiences and wanted to find ways to improve the situation. That's why I started this project, trying to optimize exam timetables automatically. The idea of a highly optimized exam timetable will be very useful to teachers in arranging timetables. Currently, this must be a labour-intensive task. The algorithm behind tries to maximize the minimum revision time between subjects for students. This ensures students will all have some time to study before the next exam subject comes. The current version assumes each exam is one-hour only and the subject duration will be able to be varied in the future.
